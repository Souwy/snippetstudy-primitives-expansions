## Description
This is about using the function `.CharAt`and adding characters to it.

<!---
personal note: use ctrl+f and lookup "continued" to find where you haven't finish.

## Learning objectives (keywords)
* `.charAt(x)`
* `.replace(x,y)`

## Code snippet
```js
"a string".charAt(2) + "ee";
    // s0: (string,"a string")
    "a string".charAt (2)        
    // s1: (string, "s")
    "s" + "ee";
    // s2: (string, "see")
    "see";
```

## States deconstruction
S0. you begin with the starting point: you have a string and the value is "a string".  
S1. you apply a method to this string called .chartat, which takes the character at a precise index (position in the line). here the index is 2.
    the operation is "take the character at position 2 in the string". the response state will then be a string with the value "s"
S2. you want to add the string "ee" to your previour string, to make the word "see".

## Vocabulary

an object:
a method:
.Charat(x): takes a string and returns the char at index 'x'.

## Review
* Struggles: 
  * fully understand the definition of a method
  * operators
* Learning objectives that need extra work?
